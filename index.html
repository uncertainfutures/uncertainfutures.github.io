<p>
  Decision making in the face of
  <a href="theory/multiple-plausible-futures/">multiple plausible futures</a> is
  emerging as a key capability in the face of global and climate change. The
  future is described not by forecasts or probability distributions, but by
  multiple "<a href="theory/scenario-development/">scenarios</a>". This is also
  called <a href="theory/dmdu/">Decision making under deep uncertainty</a>.
</p>
<p>
  We want to make decisions that are "<a href="theory/robust-decisions/"
    >robust</a
  >" and "<a href="theory/adaptive-decisions/">adaptive</a>" even when our knowledge 
  of the future is shaky.
  </p> 
  <p>Different assumptions and hypotheses can be explored using <a href="theory/exploratory-modelling/"
    >exploratory modelling</a>, <a href="theory/scenario-development/">scenario development</a>
    or "<a href="theory/stress-testing/">stress testing</a>" of decision alternatives.
  </p>
  <p>
  We can <a href="theory/management-options/">design better management options</a> by
  evaluating their <a href="theory/robustness-metrics/">robustness</a>, anticipating 
  <a href="theory/vulnerability-analysis/">vulnerabilities</a>, 
  reasoning about <a href="theory/value-of-information/">future information</a> and
  <a href="theory/uncertainty-delegation/">responsibilities</a>, 
  and planning <a href="theory/adaptive-pathways">adaptive pathways</a>,
  <a href="theory/signposts/">signposts</a> and 
  <a href="theory/triggers/">triggers</a>.

  This website synthesises reference materials about theory, software tools, and
  examples for decision making in the face of multiple plausible futures. If in
