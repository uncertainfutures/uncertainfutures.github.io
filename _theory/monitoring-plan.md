decomposition: >
  Developing a monitoring plan is based on assumptions about the future and indicators and targets would be chosen accordingly by identifying relevant changes in future conditions.
  If talking about the monitoring of the plan design, implementation and operation, indicators and targets are then generally independent from external factors and more internal to the plan.
