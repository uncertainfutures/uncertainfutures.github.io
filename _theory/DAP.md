excerpt: DAP is a <a href="../theory/dmdu/"> DMDU </a> approach to design adaptive and robust plans. It is based on concepts associated to Assumption-Based Planning (ABP) [3] in which a plan is valid under an assertion (assumption) made about future conditions. The approach is also known as (Dynamic) Adaptive Policymaking [5].
purpose: >
<p> 
DAP [1,2] aims at designing adaptive and robust plans, i.e., plans considering actions to implement immediately (near-term actions) and in the future (alternative actions) to cope with <a href="../theory/multiple-plausible-futures/">multiple plausible futures </a>. 
</p>
requirements: >
<p>
The improach requires stakeholder participation in the design process [1,4,5] and a explicit monitoring plan to evaluate the plan/policy performance post-implementation [4,5].  
</p>
decomposition: >
<p>
Two main steps are identified: a design step and an implementation step [4]. 
</p>
<p> The design stage of DAP (figure 1) aims at building a flexible plan, able to adapt to future conditions and reduce the vulnerabilities of the assumptions underlying the plan [1,4]. 
</p>

</p>
<p> The five steps of the design stage consist of [1,4]: 
<ol>
<li>
Step 1 consists of setting the scene with defining constraints, objectives, definition of success for the objectives and plausible actions. The definition of success is based on the specification of objectives and constraints (e.g., economic, emission loads) that stakeholders, involved in the planning design stage, would find acceptable.
</li>
<li>
Step 2 is the assembly of the initial plan (basic policy). Two activities are considered: 1) the specification of the policy actions to achieve the objectives, and 2) the explicit outline of the necessary conditions of success (in terms of acceptable outcomes or results). The last activity is of importance to later identify vulnerabilities, signposts and triggers. 
</li>
<li>
Step 3 consists in the assessment of vulnerabilities or opportunities for the policy and identification of actions to improve the robustness of the initial plan.  
<ul>
<li> Methods to assess vulnerabilities involve analytical tools such as Exploratory Modelling and Assessment (EMA), scenario analysis or expert opinions using SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis.
</li>
<li> Five types of actions could be used based on the level of certainty regarding vulnerabilities or to proactively deal with external events and consist of:
<ul>
<li> Mitigating actions (M): to reduce adverse impacts from certain or more likely vulnerabilities </li>
<li> Hedging actions (H): to reduce adverse impacts associated with uncertain vulnerabilities </li>
<li> Seizing actions (SZ): to take advantage of certain or more likely opportunities </li>
<li> Exploiting qctions (E): to take advantage of (uncertain) new developments to enhance the plan chance of success </li>
<li> Shaping actions (SH): proactive actions to affect external events or conditions that could reduce the risks of failure or increase the chance of success of the plan </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul> 
</li>
<li>
Step 4 is based on the setting of a monitoring plan. Signposts (i.e., variables to monitor) are designed based on the identification of the necessary conditions of success for the plan. Additionnally, the threshold values (triggers) for considering new actions (including contingency actions) to support the plan successful achievement need to be specifically defined. Overall, the monitoring stage in DAP is what allow for the flexibility and adaptivity of the plan.
</li>
<li> Step 5 focuses on the preparation of the trigger responses and provides directions regarding the conditions to consider for implementing contingency actions post-implementation of the plan. These contingency actions are defined over the duration of the plan and their preparation include financial and legal pre-requirements, blueprint design for engineering work or case study analysis, among examples. Four types of contingency actions could be considered:
<ul>
<li> Defensive actions (DA): responsive actions to clarify the plan, preserve its benefits or meet outside challenges in response to specific triggers, but leaving the initial plan unchanged. </li>
<li> Corrective actions (CR): adjustments to the initial plan in response to specific triggers. </li>
<li> Capitalizing actions (CP): responsive actions to take advantage of opportunities to improve the initial plan performance. </li>
<li> Reassessment (RE): initiate when the analysis and assumptions underpinning the plan are no longer valid. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p> 
The implementation stage is based on the implementation of the initial plan set up in step 2 of the design process, followed by adaptive actions (step 3) according to how future conditions may unfold, and the establishment of the monitoring plan (step 4). Contingency actions (step 5) are considered post-implementation of the plan based on signposts' trigger events.

<p>
The approach has been used in conjunction with the <a href="../theory/adaptation-pathways/"> adaptation pathways </a> to design the  <a href="../theory/DAPP/"> DAPP </a> approach, another <a href="../theory/dmdu/"> DMDU </a> approach.
