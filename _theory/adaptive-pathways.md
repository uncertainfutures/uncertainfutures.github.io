title: Adaptive pathways
permalink: /theory/adaptive-pathways/
excerpt: Adaptive pathways consist of sequences of options that can be taken and the circumstances in which alternative sequences might be selected. Adaptiveness is an attribute of a system allowing it to cope with different future uncertainties. Planning of "adaptation pathways" contributes to adaptiveness by enabling investment in an initial management option knowing that changes can be made during implementation of the plan.
purpose: >
  <p> What is meant by 'adaptive' and 'adaptation' pathways is associated with the distinction between the attributes of a system allowing it to cope with different future uncertainties and the process to cope with such vulnerabilities [15]. In other words, adaptation pathways is an analytical approach providing a process in terms of deciding when and under which conditions acceptable actions need to be implemented to cope against multiple plausible futures. Adaptive pathways are the sequence of actions (i.e., attributes) for the system to be able to cope with multiple plausible futures.</p>
