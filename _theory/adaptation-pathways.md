excerpt: Adaptation Pathways is a familly of methods belonging to DMDU approaches to support decision-makers' reflection about the robustness of management decisions over time and ability to cope with multiple plausible futures, in particular with climate change uncertainty. 
purpose: >
<p>
Adaptation Pathways (APs)  [1,2] approaches are decision aids under the umbrella  of <a href="../theory/dmdu"> DMDU </a> approaches. They aim at supporting decision makers' reflection about the robustness and adaptiveness of diverse measures and management decisions against <a href="../theory/multiple-plausible-futures"> multiple plausible futures </a> [3]. 
</p>
<p>
APs do not aim at providing a best solution but at reflecting on the feasibility of multiple routes to achieve an objective. It also encourages decision-making over time to continuously adapt to future changes  [1,2].
</p>
<p> 
APs approaches could be categorised according to three dimensions: 1) the level of ambiguity in goals, 2) the level of epistemic (knowledge) uncertainty and 3) power relationships [5]. Figure 1 provides an illustration of the classification of different APs approaches based on these three dimensions [5].

</p>
<p> 
Among the different approaches depicted in figure 1, the <a href="../theory/DAPP/"> DAPP </a> approach is described as appropriate to inform water management decisions in situations of water scarcity and increasing competition for water resources, with highly uncertain projections regarding the future of the supply. The goals are generally unambiguous and agreed upon and the visualisation approach needs to be developed in a participatory setting and aims at promoting deliberations and negotiations among decision-makers [5].
</p>
requirements: >
<p>
To apply the approach, computer-assisted approaches are required to identify the conditions and expected timing of occurance for TPs. Computer simulations involve the creation of an uncertain space using Monte Carlo analysis, for example, to create a database of future scenarios combining different drivers (i.e., uncertain and non-manageable factors) and depicting different future conditions and values [3].
</p>
<p> 
Decision triggers are required to identify when to update or re-evaluate the plan/policy. For that matter, a monitoring plan needs to be designed to provide flexibiity and adaptability to the plan/policy.
</p>
<p>
A sequence of actions to achieve a specific objective needs to be designed and evaluated in terms of monetary costs and benefits. Valuing costs and benefits is time-dependent and values need to be discounted from expected future costs and benefits and expressed as present values (PV) [3].
</p>
<p>
The approach is participatory and require expert opinions and stakeholders involvement, in addition to computer-based approaches.
</p>
<p> Several core principles, in addition to the previous requirements, consist of  [4]: 
<ul>
<li> climate change impacts should not be considered in isolation but as part of multi-scale socio-ecological systems.</li>
<li> multiple knowledge and values need to be acknowmedged and negotiated to build a shared representation of a system of interest. </li>
<li> responses to change must be coordinated across sectors, administrative levels and scales. </li>
<li> in addition to incremental actions to address vulnerabilities, transformative strategies need to be considered to address regime shifts.</li>
<li> strategies should be "no-regret" (i.e., yielding to benefits whatever the future conditions would be).</li>
</ul>
</p>
decomposition: >
<p>
Six main steps could be identified (figure 2) [5]:
</p>
<p>
<img src="../../images/adaptation-pathways-fig2-steps.jpg" width=70% alt="Adaptation pathways six main steps. Examples of use in the context of the CoastAdapt decision support tool (C-CADS) is provided below each step heading".>
</p>
<p>
<ol>
<li>
Step 1 consists of framing the problem with identifying challenges (e.g., economic, social, ecological, climate) for the plan. This stage implies: 
<ul>
<li> identifying drivers of change (e.g., climate change, population growth), associated rate and magnitude, and potential consequences on a system of interest.</li>
<li> characterising a desirable vision and associated objectives. </li>
<li> identifying relevant stakeholders or decision-making processes, and decisions currently made, expected to be made and/or required in the future to cope with future changes and successfully achieve the objectives for a system of interest. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Step 2 consists in the assessment of risks and vulnerabilities for the system. This stage aims at identifying key risk factors and conditions for which the plan would be the most vulnerable. This step aims at identifying failure thresholds for the systems and expected time of occurence based on the identifcation of tipping points.
</li>
<li>
Step 3 consists in the identification of plausible actions to deal with vulnerabilities. It involves the consideration of agreed-upon actions with relevant stakeholders as well as actions that appear currently unfeasible or undesirable due to available resources, political support or societal preferences, among examples. These latter actions could become "opportunities" for future decision-makers to consider. 
</li>
<li>
Step 4 involves the assessment of the different actions or course of actions. This stage implies: 
<ul>
<li> the exploration of the timing to implement actions with considering their lead-time, dependencies on other decisions, and tipping points against vulnerable scenarios. </li>
<li> the selection and prioritisation of actions based on their benefits and feasibility under different scenarios, their ability to fulfil immediate needs while avoiding locks-in situations (i.e., situations limiting the implementation of future required actions) and, potentially, co-benefits across different objectives. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> 
Step 5 consists of the selection of adaptation pathways. Actions to be implemented immediately are selected and the requirements to implement future actions is defined. This stage also requires the identification of conditions to support the implementation of future actions such as stakeholder agreement, legislative needs, scientific knowledge. 
</li>
<li> 
Step 6 is based on the definition of the monitoring and evaluation plan, conferring its flexibility to the plan. Decision points (i.e., signposts and associated triggers for shifting of actions) are identified and defined. If the assumptions considered in step 2 are no longer valid, the plan needs to be re-evaluated.

examples:
  - Climate change adaptation and flood management strategy for London and the Thames Estuary until 2100 [2]. 
  - Development of the Regional Climate Change Adaptation Plan for the Eyre Peninsula for coastal and sectoral adaptation to climate change. Adaptation pathways for different sectoral objectives were designed and led to adaptation priorities to implement to support cross sectoral adaptation and biold regional resilience [6].
  - Disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation strategies for New York urban resilience against flood risks [7]. 
  - Community development adaptation pathways in Indonesia  for poverty alleviation and climate change adaptation planning. The approach involved workshops from different administrative levels to identify drivers of changes, aspirations and exploratory scenarios. It led to a roadmap from current time to 2090 with different outcomes on community livelihoods [8].  
  - Coupling cost-benefit analysis to adaptation pathways to identify 'investment tipping points' to consider, in addition to the robustness of actions against future scenarios, the economic desirability of investment choices [11].
  - Engaging stakeholders in adaptive planning design using Scenario Workshop with Adaptation Pathways (SWAP) for creating a shared vision for coastal adaptation against climate change in Portugal [12].
