title: Adaptation pathways
permalink: /theory/adaptation-pathways/
excerpt: Adaptation pathways is an analytical approach for undertaking planning and implementation under uncertainty and change. It provides a process for deciding when and under which conditions acceptable actions need to be implemented to cope with multiple plausible futures. In contrast, an "adaptive" pathway refers to the ability of a system to cope with different future uncertainties.
purpose: >
  <p> What is meant by 'adaptive' and 'adaptation' pathways is associated with the distinction between the attributes of a system allowing it to cope with different future uncertainties and the process to cope with such vulnerabilities [15]. In other words, adaptation pathways is an analytical approach providing a process in terms of deciding when and under which conditions acceptable actions need to be implemented to cope against multiple plausible futures. Adaptive pathways are the sequence of actions (i.e., attributes) for the system to be able to cope with multiple plausible futures.</p>
