This website was created as a means of synthesizing theoretical and case study
materials about decision making in the face of multiple plausible futures.

<p>
  Initial development of this website was funded by the
  <a href="https://watermodelling.org">Queensland Water Modelling Network</a>
  Small Grants Program 2020 in recognition of the importance of the issue of
  communication of scenario results and the need for work to adapt decision
  frameworks to local use cases and increase their adoption.

  showcase modelling to end user communication good practice that cover decision
  making, model outputs, constraints and risks, and encourage critical thinking
  by including them as resources in training.
